In this assignment I implemented a catan game (with the rules I understood, I do not know this game.
I wrote a Player class, a Board class, a Catan class and a frontend class.  
I will explain them one by one.  
`The Player class` - This class represent a player in the game. The class has a resources bank that saves how much the player has of every resource.  
Players methods:  
* `Player()` : a constructor.
* `updateVictoryPoints()`
* `updateResource()`
* `updateKnightCount()`
* `getVictoryPoints()`
* 'getResorceCount()`
* `getResourcesCount()` : returns the sum of the resources the player has.
* `getKnightCount()`
* `getID()`
